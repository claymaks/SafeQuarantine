# Safe Quarantine

One of our six roommates tested positive for Covid-19, but the other five of us had not been exposed.  We decided to take the highest level of precaution and completely isolate in our own rooms.  This meant texting our group chat every time someone left to use our single communal bathroom or kitchen.

To reduce notifications, this web app will allow roommates to say whether they are using the bathroom or kitchen.
